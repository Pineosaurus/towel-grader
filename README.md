# Towel Grader

A web tool for grading the quality of towel-folding episodes performed by humanoid robots, designed to help train vision-language models. Users evaluate episodes by selecting quality factors and difficulty ratings through a guided questionnaire that automatically assigns grades (A, B, C) and difficulty levels (Easy, Hard).
